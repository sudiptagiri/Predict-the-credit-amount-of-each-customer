# Predict-the-credit-amount-of-each-customer
Predict the credit amount of each customer with different regressor algorithms of machine learning techniques<br>
<br>
 Predicting credit amounts for customers is a common task in finance and lending.<br>
 To achieve this, we use machine learning models.<br>
 <br>
 The general steps to predict credit amounts:<br>
<br>
Data Collection and Preprocessing:<br>
Gathered historical data on customers, including features such as income, employment status, credit score, loan purpose, etc.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
<br>
Feature Engineering:<br>
Created relevant features from the existing data.Normalize and scale numerical features.
<br>
Model Selection:<br>
Choosed an appropriate machine learning model. Common choices including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Consider the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.
<br>
Model Training:<br>
Split our data into training and validation sets.
Train the selected model on the training data.
<br>
Model Evaluation:<br>
Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as R-SQUARE,ADJUSENT R-SQUARE Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Adjusted hyperparameters where necessary.
<br>
Predictions:<br>
Useed the trained model to predict credit amounts for new customers based on their features.
